    "The game of Chutes and Ladders is pretty well known. What you didn't known until now is that you'd be cutting your Python chops in creating a simulation of the game for the purpose of gaining some serious insight. By keeping track of your simulations you'll learn some interesting things about such a simple game."

    "The basic idea is to try to get to square 100 starting at 0. You role a die (or spin a wheel) and play against others doing the same. If you finish a turn at the base of a ladder, you go to the top. If you finish a turn at the top of a chute (slide) you go down to the bottom of the slide. Familiarize yourself with the [full rules](http://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad2614c1c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/43EA24525056900B105B53AC74279484.pdf).\n",

    "Next, create `Pawn` class that keeps track of the location of a player and simulates (using the `random` module) the Pawn movement. You should also create a `Game` class that keeps track of the game play as many Pawns move throughout the board. By calling a method of Game `.run()` a full Game is simulated.\n",
